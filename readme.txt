> “Amazing Plugin and Support: The plugin does what it says and works perfectly in executing it. It’s a clean code and light-weight plugin. The support is also top-notch.” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  [carmpocalypse](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/amazing-plugin-and-support-126/)

Free shipping is a powerful incentive for customers to complete a purchase, everybody loves to get something for “Free”. That’s why with our plugin you can increase your eCommerce sales with just a few tweaks into how your store looks and how to convert visitors into buyers.

Our plugin lets you display the amount left for free shipping in WooCommerce, it works as a reminder for your customers for of how much is left for them to get there free shipping, and it’s an incentive too as encourages them to add more products into their carts to get the free shipping.

A simple plugin like that adds some psychological tricks which can increase the average cart value in your store and thus increase your profitability.

Your customers will know in real time the amount left in their cart for free shipping, you can customize the shipping criteria to fit your strategic goals, and you can customize the message so you can try different CTAs and see what works best for your customers.

In a nutshell, this is what the plugin can do:

1. Show messages on different locations telling customers how much is remaining to get Free Shipping.

2. Customize options on when the messages appear (below specific threshold) or if specific shipping methods are disabled.

3. Show amount left for free shipping messages using widgets & shortcode, meaning you can -literally- show it in any location on your store.

4. Manually select the minimum amount to be eligible for free shipping, overwriting the amount set by WooCommerce standard free shipping (or any other non-standard method you use for free shipping)

Let's get into more details and see what features the plugin offers.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version ##

### 🚀 Amount left for Free shipping Messages ###

Show your customers the amount left they need to add to cart in order to get free shipping, control text using variables like amount spent, amount remaining, total amount to get free shipping.

For example, if you set the free shipping at $100, and customer has $70 in cart, you can show the 3 values for them (or any part of it):
You have $70 in your cart, spend $30 more to get free shipping at $100 

### 🚀 Show messages anywhere on your store ###

You can show messages anywhere on your store, the plugin allows (by default) showing the "Amount Left for Free shipping" messages on cart, but also you can show it anywhere using our shortcode, or from widgets available in your theme.

Tailor this to your store and show it in products pages, categories, homepage, or anywhere you think it might make your customers encouraged to spend more to get your offer.

### 🚀 Show message only on reaching certain amounts ###

If cart is below a specific value, you can select to hide the messages and only show them when customers reach a specific value.

For example, if free shipping is on $100, you can only start showing "Amount left for free shipping" messages if cart value is $50, so customers with any lesser amount will not see the message.

### 🚀 Control Message Position & Styling on Cart page ###

From within the plugin settings, you can select from 15+ placements in the cart page to show the free shipping message, you can show it before cart, before cart table, on cart content, after table, and much more options.

You can also customize text style by altering font type & size so it aligns with your site color & cart design.

### 🚀 Customize Minimum Order Amount For Free Shipping Setting ###

Keep your systems consistent and well synchronized by setting the minimum order amount automatically from the free shipping method or set it manually by yourself for further control and flexibility.

By default, the plugin reads the minimum order required for free shipping from WooCommerce >> Shipping >> Free shipping method (Minimum order amount field).

You can overwrite this value from plugin settings if the default method isn't working properly, this defined amount will have higher priority over the one in WooCommerce settings.

### 🚀 Set Amount Left for Free Shipping By User Role ###

If you want to customize free shipping amount by user role, the plugin allows you to specify the amount left to get free shipping by user roles defined on your store (built-in & custom roles).

For instance, you can allow your wholesaler customers to get free shipping on orders above $1000, but for regular customers you can offer that as low as $100 if needed.

### 🚀 Set Amount Left for Free Shipping By Currency ###

Similar to the user role option, the plugin allows you to customize the amount left for free shipping based on currency. Select & customize values based on all WooCommerce supported currencies.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the amount left message doesn't seem to get displayed in the proper position? =
Some positions are located inside tables, so it's necessary to wrap the content in HTML table row tags.
Most probably, these positions will have `(in table)` appended.
In such cases, the best solution to wrap the content is by using the **Wrapper options** section.
When it happens, please try to set the **Wrap method** option as **Smart**.
Besides that, most likely the **Wrap template** option should be set as:
`
<tr><th></th><td>{content}</td></tr>
`
You can optionally add a column title for the message if you wish like this:
`
<tr><th>Free shipping</th><td>{content}</td></tr>


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Start by visiting plugin settings at "WooCommerce > Settings > Amount Left for Free Shipping".

== Screenshots ==

1. In order to see the plugin working on the frontend, enable the Cart section.
2. It's possible to specify a custom message to the user on frontend when the free shipping is available.
3. An example of the amount left text being displayed on frontend after the Cart section is enabled.
