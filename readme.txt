Our plugin lets you display the amount left for free shipping in WooCommerce, it works as a reminder for your customers for of how much is left for them to get there free shipping, and it’s an incentive too as encourages them to add more products into their carts to get the free shipping.

A simple plugin like that adds some psychological tricks which can increase the average cart value in your store and thus increase your profitability.

Your customers will know in real time the amount left in their cart for free shipping, you can customize the shipping criteria to fit your strategic goals, and you can customize the message so you can try different CTAs and see what works best for your customers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the amount left message doesn't seem to get displayed in the proper position? =
Some positions are located inside tables, so it's necessary to wrap the content in HTML table row tags.
Most probably, these positions will have `(in table)` appended.
In such cases, the best solution to wrap the content is by using the **Wrapper options** section.
When it happens, please try to set the **Wrap method** option as **Smart**.
Besides that, most likely the **Wrap template** option should be set as:
`
<tr><th></th><td>{content}</td></tr>
`
You can optionally add a column title for the message if you wish like this:
`
<tr><th>Free shipping</th><td>{content}</td></tr>
