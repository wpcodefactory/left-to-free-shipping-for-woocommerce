== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why the amount left message doesn't seem to get displayed in the proper position? =
Some positions are located inside tables, so it's necessary to wrap the content in HTML table row tags.
Most probably, these positions will have `(in table)` appended.
In such cases, the best solution to wrap the content is by using the **Wrapper options** section.
When it happens, please try to set the **Wrap method** option as **Smart**.
Besides that, most likely the **Wrap template** option should be set as:
`
<tr><th></th><td>{content}</td></tr>
`
You can optionally add a column title for the message if you wish like this:
`
<tr><th>Free shipping</th><td>{content}</td></tr>
`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Start by visiting plugin settings at "WooCommerce > Settings > Amount Left for Free Shipping".

== Screenshots ==

1. In order to see the plugin working on the frontend, enable the Cart section.
2. It's possible to specify a custom message to the user on frontend when the free shipping is available.
3. An example of the amount left text being displayed on frontend after the Cart section is enabled.
