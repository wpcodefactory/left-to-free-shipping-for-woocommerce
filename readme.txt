== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the amount left message doesn't seem to get displayed in the proper position? =
Some positions are located inside tables, so it's necessary to wrap the content in HTML table row tags.
Most probably, these positions will have `(in table)` appended.
In such cases, the best solution to wrap the content is by using the **Wrapper options** section.
When it happens, please try to set the **Wrap method** option as **Smart**.
Besides that, most likely the **Wrap template** option should be set as:
`
<tr><th></th><td>{content}</td></tr>
`
You can optionally add a column title for the message if you wish like this:
`
<tr><th>Free shipping</th><td>{content}</td></tr>
